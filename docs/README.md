# Introduction

This project aims to provide an open-source test framework that could be used to test any chatbot. The script is setup so that it is easy to add a new chatbot or text generator in order to assess it, more details about this can be found in **Implementation details**. 

The script will produce a conversation between two chatters and then assess the conversation with regards to some predefined quality aspects. The quality aspects will be defined below in the **Software Requirements Specification** chapter. These quality aspects will be assessed and then written to a .xlsx-file, for the user to use for further assessment of the chatbot.

# Metrics evaluated by this testing framework
* Stuttering - using Ngrams
* Repeated questions - is any question repeated several times
* Coherence assessment - with regards to the last sentence and the whole last conversation** respectively, is the response produced by a chatter coherent.
* Toxicities - different kinds of toxicities are assessed. The presented numbers are the %-risk of the response being interpreted as the specific toxicity type.

** The whole conversation is not brought as input, since chatbots have varying sizes of input they are able to handle. Instead, a function is implemented to bring the last sentences consisting a maximum of X tokens, in order to handle this.

# Run setup



# Implementation details of a new chatter

The script is currently offering four chatter types, namely: 
* Emely
* Blenderbot 400M
* User - enabling the user to interact with the other chatter
* Predefined sentences located in predefined_conv_chatter1 and predefined_conv_chatter2

These four chatter types have been implemented as classes, in the **Classes-section** within the code. These classes all have the method **get_response(self, conv_array)** in common. This method is what mainly differs between the chatter types on how text is generated. Hence, if the user wants to add another chatbot, it only takes to three steps:
1. Define a class and its own get_response(self, conv_array)-method, more specifically how to use the source for generating input.
2. Go to the method assign_model() and add: 

```python
elif chatter_profile == {NAME OF BOT}:
    return {Class name of newly created class}(nbr)
```

3. Go to the attribute array **chatters** and change either one or both of the indices 0 and 1 to {NAME OF BOT} 
```python
chatters = ['emely', 'blenderbot']  # Chatter 1-profile is on index 0, chatter 2-profile is on index 1.
# Could be either one of ['emely', 'blenderbot', 'user', 'predefined']
```

Voil√†: the framework is setup to include your robot as well.

# Software Requirements Specification

## User stories

- Emely as the recruiter
- Emely as the fika buddy

## System Requirements

- Performance requirements (throughput, inference time, ..)
- Input filtering (requirements on rule-based filtering of toxic content)
- User experience

## ML Model Requirements

- No stuttering
- Reasonable memory
- Non-toxic

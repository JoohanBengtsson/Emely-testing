JONES, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for thenight, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes
 With thering of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurchedacross the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself alast glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up tobed, where Mrs
 Jones was already snoring
As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and afluttering all through the farm buildings
 Word had gone round duringthe day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strangedream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the otheranimals
 It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn assoon as Mr
 Jones was safely out of the way
 Old Major (so he wasalways called, though the name under which he had been exhibited wasWillingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyonewas quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had tosay
At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major wasalready ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung froma beam
 He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, buthe was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolentappearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut
Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselvescomfortable after their different fashions
 First came the three dogs,Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in thestraw immediately in front of the platform
 The hens perchedthemselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters,the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew thecud
 The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walkingvery slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lestthere should be some small animal concealed in the straw
 Clover was astout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite gother figure back after her fourth foal
 Boxer was an enormous beast,nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horsesput together
 A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupidappearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he wasuniversally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendouspowers of work
 After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, andBenjamin, the donkey
 Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm,and the worst tempered
 He seldom talked, and when he did, it wasusually to make some cynical remark-for instance, he would say thatGod had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would soonerhave had no tail and no flies
 Alone among the animals on the farm henever laughed
 If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laughat
 Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer;the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the smallpaddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking
The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, whichhad lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly andwandering from side to side to find some place where they would notbe trodden on
 Clover made a sort of wall round them with her greatforeleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fellasleep
 At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare whodrew Mr
 Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump ofsugar
 She took a place near the front and began flirting her whitemane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with
Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmestplace, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; thereshe purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to aword of what he was saying
All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, whoslept on a perch behind the back door
